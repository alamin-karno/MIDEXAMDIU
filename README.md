named FirstActivity and SecondActivity. In the FirstActivity, It has two EditText components 
and two button. In the first EditText , you will give your name as input, and in the second EditText 
, give your student id(String) as input. Out of the two buttons, one will be named the “Count” 
button, and the other one will be the “GoTo” button. If you press the Count button, a counter will 
increase for once.If you press the “GoTo” button, you will switch from FirstActivity to the 
SecondActivity. Before going to the SecondActivity, it will pass your name ,student id from 
the EditText components and a value equal to the last count from the Count Button. Then show 
the all information in the SecondActivity along with a welcome message.
